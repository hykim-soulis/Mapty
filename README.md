# Mapty

The goal of this application is to log the running and cycling workout's location, duration and distance information with popup pins on the map for users.

## Project Description

This application helps users to log their workout records on the map.

The application automatically obtains user's current location coordinates using geolocation api when the user first load and displays the location on the right side. When the user clicks the workout location on the map, an input form appears on the left side.
Fills out the form and preeses enter, user can see the popup pin on the map with the workout information.
The application uses local storage to preserve the previous records even though the user reload the app.

### What I've learned
